There are steps involved in Data Analysis Process.

Before writing an algorithm we need to get familiar with data.


1. The process begins with A question you want to answer or problem you want to solve. This might be something like, 
- Characteristics of students who pass their projects?
- How can i better stock my store with the products people most want to buy?

2. The next step of the process is Data Wrangling.
This has two parts, data acquisition and data cleaning.

- Data Acquistion : First you need to acquire the data that you need to answer your question or solve your problem. 
- Data Cleaning : Then begin investigating the data and cleaning up any problems that you find. 

3. The third phase is Data Exploration.
In this we spend some time getting familiar with your data, building your intuition about it and finding patterns.
Once you're familiar with your data you'll usually want to draw some conclusion about it or maybe make some predictions. 
For example, Netflix's movie recommendation systems needs to predict which movie users will like.
Also, the Facebook paper concluded that users are less likely to click certain articals, specially one's written from a different ideological perspective than the user has. 

This phase usually invloves statistics or machine learning that are beyond the scope of this course.

4. Communication Phase : We need to communicate the findings to other people.

The findings are only useful as your ability to communicate them. Even if your end goal is to build some sort of systems, like a movie recommender or a news feed ranking algorithm, you'll usually need to share what you've built and how it works with your team. 

There are various methods to communicate. You might write a blog post, a paper, an email, a PowerPoint presentation, or just have an in-person conversation.

Data visualization is a technique that's almost useful when communicating findings about data.

This process doesn't actually follow a straight line. Especially the data wrangling phase and to the data exploration phase are very intertwined because you can't really clean any problems with the data before you take a look to see what problems there are. And even when you think you're done wrangling and you're ready to just explore, you'll keep finding more problems and have to go back.

Throughout the process, you may need to return to your question and refine it as you become more familiar with the data set.
Sometimes data acquistion actually comes before you pose a question. If a new, exciting data is released, take a look and see what's there, and then think of some questions that you could answer with that data.
