# This code is the same we have discussed in CSV file. 

import unicodecsv

enrollments_filename = '/datasets/ud170/udacity-students/enrollments.csv'

## Longer version of code (replaced with shorter, equivalent version below)

# enrollments = []
# f = open(enrollments_filename, 'rb')
# reader = unicodecsv.DictReader(f)
# for row in reader:
#     enrollments.append(row)
# f.close()

# Problem

### Write code similar to the above to load the engagement
### and submission data. The data is stored in files with
### the given filenames. Then print the first row of each
### table to make sure that your code works. You can use the
### "Test Run" button to see the output of your code.

engagement_filename = '/datasets/ud170/udacity-students/daily_engagement.csv'
submissions_filename = '/datasets/ud170/udacity-students/project_submissions.csv'
    
daily_engagement = None     # Replace this with your code
project_submissions = None  # Replace this with your code

# Solution

import unicodecsv

def read_csv(filename):
    with open(filename, 'rb') as f:
        reader = unicodecsv.DictReader(f)
        return list(reader)

enrollments = read_csv('enrollments.csv')
daily_engagement = read_csv('daily_engagement.csv')
project_submissions = read_csv('project_submissions.csv')
