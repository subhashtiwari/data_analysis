In this phase we get familiar with the data.

To know the data we are going to ask this question.

How do numbers in the daily engagement table differ for the students who pass the first project?

Question : There are few things about this question as stated that are under specified or would be a wit weird. These are listed below.

1. This will include data from after the project submission.
2. This compares data from different lengths of time.
3. It includes engagement courses not related to the first project.
 
To overcome first and second problems we need only to look at engagement from first week and exclude students who cancels within a week. This way we will be comparing equal amounts of time. 
This will also have benefit of excluding people who cancelled during the free trial which was seven days at the time the data was collected.
